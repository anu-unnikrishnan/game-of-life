GUIDE TO CONWAY'S GAME OF LIFE.
-------------------------------

We start with a grid of cells. The player picks the positions of live cells at the start. The cells then evolve according to the following rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
